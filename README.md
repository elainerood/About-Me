# About Me

Iâ€™ve been playing around with data in some form since I first started tracking my sleep in 2011. In 2013, I took a "Computer Science for Science and Math" course because it sounded useful - little did I know I would also love it! Learned Python and R in that class, but have primarily used R in the intervening time.

My sleep data analysis went from a highly involved process (entering the information from the recording app and making manually-binned pseudo-histograms in Apple Numbers) to something largely automated (a script reading in the SQL file where the information was stored, and generating graphs of several types).

I love data visualization and digging into trends within data, but what I work on at any given time is highly variable and often project-driven. I've dipped my toes into HTML and CSS, digging through JSON files, some text wrangling, and more, based on whatever held my interest at the time.
